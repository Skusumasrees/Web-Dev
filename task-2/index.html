Elements are the building blocks of HTML pages, and are represented by tags. HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page.</p>

    <h2>HTML Syntax</h2>
    <p>HTML uses a simple syntax that consists of elements and tags. Elements are the building blocks of HTML pages, and are represented by tags. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets, like &lt;tag&gt;. Most tags have an opening tag and a closing tag, with content in between. Some tags are self-closing and do not require a closing tag. HTML tags are not case-sensitive, but it is common practice to use lowercase letters. Attributes can be added to tags to provide additional information about the element, such as the src attribute for images.</p>

    <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. They are represented by tags, which define the structure and content of the page. Elements can be nested inside other elements to create a hierarchy of content. Some common HTML elements include headings, paragraphs, links, images, and lists. Each element has a specific purpose and can be styled using CSS. Understanding HTML elements is essential for creating well-structured and accessible web pages.</p>
