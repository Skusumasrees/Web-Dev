SVG in HTML
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) has become an indispensable part of modern web development. SVG enables developers to create high-quality, scalable graphics that look crisp at any size or resolution. In this blog post, we'll explore the basics of using SVG in HTML, its benefits, and some practical examples.

What is SVG?
SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. Unlike raster images like PNGs or JPGs, SVGs are not pixel-based. They're composed of vectorsâ€”mathematical formulas that describe shapes, paths, and fills. This means SVGs can be resized without losing quality.

Why Use SVG?
Scalability
SVG images can be scaled indefinitely without losing quality, which is ideal for responsive web design.

File Size
SVG files are often smaller than their raster counterparts, especially for simple shapes and icons.

Flexibility
SVGs can be styled, animated, and manipulated using CSS and JavaScript.

How to Embed SVG in HTML
SVG can be embedded in HTML in several ways:

Inline SVG: Directly writing the SVG XML code within HTML.
Using an <img> tag: Point the src attribute to an SVG file.
Using CSS: Setting SVG as a background image in a CSS file.
Inline SVG Example
<svg height="100" width="100">
    <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="red" />
</svg>
<img> Tag Example
<img src="image.svg" alt="Sample SVG">
CSS Background Example
.background {
          background-image: url('image.svg');
        }
SVG Attributes
SVG comes with a set of attributes to control its behavior:

width and height: To set the dimensions.
viewBox: To set the coordinate system.
fill and stroke: To set the colors.
Practical Examples
Creating a Simple Icon
<svg height="30" width="30">
    <rect width="30" height="30" style="fill:rgb(0,0,255);stroke-width:1;stroke:rgb(0,0,0)" />
</svg>
Creating Complex Shapes
SVG can also be used to create more complex shapes like polygons, lines, and text.

Conclusion
SVG offers a powerful way to add scalable and interactive graphics to your HTML documents. Its compatibility with CSS and JavaScript makes it a versatile choice for modern web development. Whether you're creating simple icons or intricate illustrations, SVG has got you covered.
